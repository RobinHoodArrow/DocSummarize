The Senate has passed a bill that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide for corporate tax reform. The bill would impose a new corporate alternative minimum tax, and would exempt certain corporations from the tax. The bill would also allow for a corporate AMT foreign tax credit. This section of the bill deals with the treatment of foreign corporations for the purposes of the repurchase of stock by a covered corporation. The bill establishes a new program to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part B and D enrollees, and sets the maximum fair price for a selected drug at the price negotiated by the program. This section of the bill establishes exceptions for small biotech drugs from the definition of "negotiation-eligible drug." This section of the bill requires manufacturers to provide access to maximum fair prices for drugs to certain eligible individuals and entities during the price applicability period. Additionally, the bill increases the initial coverage limit and out-of-pocket threshold for 2025.
